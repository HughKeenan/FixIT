## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to **FixIT – AI-Powered Tech Support for Families!**  
This platform aims to assist families in providing straightforward tech support, particularly for older adults. FixIT allows users to describe a problem and instantly get AI-generated, easy-to-understand guidance.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Many older users struggle with everyday tech problems and often lack immediate support. FixIT bridges this gap by:

- Providing simple, understandable solutions for common tech issues  
- Offering a clean, user-friendly interface  
- Leveraging AI to interpret user questions and deliver relevant, helpful advice  
- (Planned) Enabling remote support from family or professional agents  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Input** – The user types a problem (e.g., "My Wi-Fi isn't working.")  
2. **AI Processing** – The input is analyzed using AI to identify intent and key terms  
3. **Knowledge Base Lookup** – The issue is matched with known problems from a curated database  
4. **Solution Display** – The platform presents a friendly, step-by-step solution  

---

## 🗃️ Core Models

- **Problem** – Stores tech issue descriptions and keywords  
- **Solution** – Offers step-by-step instructions tied to one or more problems  
- *(Planned)* **Device** – Enables device-specific troubleshooting  
- *(Planned)* **User Profiles** – Tracks past queries to personalize future responses  

---

## 🔮 AI Integration

- **Current** – Uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o API for natural language understanding  

**Planned Enhancements:**

- Intent recognition (e.g., “can’t connect to Wi-Fi” vs. “slow internet”)  
- Entity extraction (e.g., printer, browser, email)  
- Personalized recommendations based on user history
