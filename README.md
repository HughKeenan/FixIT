## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to **FixIT - AI-Powered Tech Support for Families!**  
This platform is designed to help families provide simple, accessible tech support, especially for older adults who may not be tech-savvy. FixIT enables users to describe their technical issues and receive clear, step-by-step solutions powered by AI.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Many older users struggle with basic tech problems and don’t always have immediate access to help. FixIT is built to bridge this gap by:

- Providing simple, understandable solutions for common tech problems  
- Offering a clean, user-friendly interface  
- Using AI to interpret user questions and return helpful, tailored advice  
- Potentially enabling remote assistance from family or support agents  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Input:** A user types a problem (e.g., "My Wi-Fi isn't working").  
2. **AI Processing:** The input is analyzed using AI to detect intent and keywords.  
3. **Knowledge Base Lookup:** The platform matches the issue to known problems in the database.  
4. **Solution Display:** A friendly, easy-to-follow solution is displayed to the user.  

---

## 🗃️ Core Models

- **Problem**: Stores known tech issues and common keywords.  
- **Solution**: Contains step-by-step guidance linked to one or more problems.  
- *(Planned)* **Device**: Support for device-specific troubleshooting.  
- *(Planned)* **User Profiles**: To track past queries and customize responses.  

---

## 🔮 AI Integration

- **Current**: Using OpenAI's GPT-4o API for natural language understanding.

**Planned Features:**

- Intent recognition (e.g., “can’t connect to internet” vs “slow connection”)  
- Entity extraction (e.g., printer, email, Wi-Fi)  
- Personalized suggestions based on past issues or devices
